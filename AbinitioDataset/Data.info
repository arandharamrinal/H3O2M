A dataset containing xyz coordinate, energies, forces, and dipole moments of hydroxide hydrate. All data are obtained at the CCSD(T)/AVTZ level of theory using CFOUR2.1 software.

h3o2m_traindata.tar, h3o2m_validation_data.tar, and h3o2m_testdata.tar contains the training, validation, and test data, respectively. See J. Phys. Chem. A 128, 1600 (2024) [DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpca.3c08027] for details of the construction of the dataset.

Units are :

Energy = Hartree (relative to the global minimum)

Geometry = Bohr

Forces = Hartree/Bohr

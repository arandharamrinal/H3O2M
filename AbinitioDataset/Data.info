A dataset containing xyz coordinate, energies, forces, and dipole moments of hydroxide hydrate. All data are obtained at the CCSD(T)/AVTZ level of theory using CFOUR2.1 software.

ffextFiles.tar:  Contains 15024  separate files for each geometry with the '.ffext' extension.  

Units are :

Energy = Hartree (relative to the global minimum)

Geometry = Bohr

Forces = Hartree/Bohr

trainfiles.txt, validfiles.txt, and testfiles.txt  files contain '.ffext' filenames of the training, validation, and test data, respectively, as used in the paper link.
